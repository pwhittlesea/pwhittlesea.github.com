I am currently living in Southampton with my partner (whom I dote on), my 4 cats (whom I tolerate me) and 2 dogs (whom I fuss over).

I graduated from the University of Southampton in 2012 and have since been working my way up the ranks to my current role as a Software Architect.

Which type of architect? Enterprise? System? Well, I guess I do a mix of it all.
Some days I am writing library code that will be used in a handful of applications, other days I am designing solutions that will have wide ranging impact on the way the business works. It all depends what interests me and whats needed of me on a given day.

I am currently at [Cirium](https://cirium.com) in Southampton (which was [Snowflake Software Ltd.](https://www.cirium.com/thoughtcloud/snowflake-software-agrees-to-join-cirium/)).

For more information on my skills and job history, see my [CV](/cv/).
