summary: "It's that time of the year again, more short stories following last years success"
---

Last year I did the [Twelve Days of Short Stories]({{< ref "2024-11-24-12-days-of-short-stories" >}}), and it was a lot of fun.

This year I am going to do it again.
Unfortunately, I have not written anything since then, but "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again".

As a reminder, this is my attempt to `embrace the suck`; accept I am not good at writing, and just write.
The goal is to write a short story every other day for twelve days, starting on the 1^st^ of December and finishing on the 23^rd^.

As a small change on last year, instead of selecting a point of view for the story, I have selected a random genre.

This year's prompts are:

| Day                                                  | Primary Word  | Backup Word   | Genre              |

| ~~15~~                                               | `mirror`      | `kneel`       | `Romance`          |

| [21]({{< ref "2025-12-days-of-short-stories-21" >}}) | `bake`        | ~~`fight`~~   | `Fairy Tale`       |
| [23]({{< ref "2025-12-days-of-short-stories-23" >}}) | `document`    | ~~`profit`~~  | `Crime`            |

Let's see how I do!
