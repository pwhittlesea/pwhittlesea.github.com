This year was worse than last year.
I only managed to finish 50% of the stories I set out to write.
Or, put another way, I successfully wrote 6 short stories.

<!--more-->

Just like [last year]({{< ref "2024-11-24-12-days-of-short-stories" >}}),
I [challenged myself]({{< ref "2025-11-13-12-days-of-short-stories-2025" >}}) to write twelve short stories over a period of twenty-four days.
This is a wash-up of how I thought it went, what I did well, and what I could have improved on.

So, as you can see I managed half of the days, completing 6/12 or 50%.

## Lessons Learned

### Genre not Point of View

Unlike last year, I decided to switch from changing the point of view, to changing the genre of each story.

Switching the point of view last year was an interesting exercise, but I found that it didn't really add much to the types of stories I was writing.
By switching the genre instead, I found that I was forced to write different types of stories, which was a good challenge.

### Too many Advents

Just before December started, not only did I set myself this challenge, but I also committed to doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenge.

I found quite quickly that my limited time in the evenings held just enough time to do one or the other, but not both.

In future, I think I will have to pick one to focus on, or change my approach from one every two days.

### Too Few Words

I think the majority of the stories that I have written suffer from being far too short.
Writing these stories in the evenings, I can hit about 1000-1500 words.
Many of the genres that were randomly generated, just need more than that to set the background, or tone.

Take day [7]({{< ref "2025-12-days-of-short-stories-7" >}}), for example.
I came up with the &mdash; frankly stupid &mdash; idea of having a 'piano killer' on the loose, but by the time I had finished the intro, I was 'out of time'.
There was more to tell in my 'Poirot-esque' day [3]({{< ref "2025-12-days-of-short-stories-3" >}}), but alas, I needed to wrap it up.

By day [17]({{< ref "2025-12-days-of-short-stories-17" >}}) I had realized that there was no way I was going to be able to set up a High Fantasy universe, and then tell a story, in so few words.
I solved this by latching onto the High Fantasy world of [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien) (which, if I am honest, felt a bit like cheating).

Maybe a more seasoned writer wouldn't have this issue.
Maybe they would be able to take the pre-existing cues that people associate with given genres and skip a lot of the set-up.
But, it does beg the question if I should change the format in future to be fewer stories; maybe one every 4 days.

### Illness

Early on in December I caught a nasty cold that laid me low for about a week.
This meant that I missed quite a few days.

There is not much I can do to avoid getting sick, other than wear a mask in crowded places during the winter months.

## Future Plans

I'm currently undecided whether I will do this challenge again next year.
I enjoyed it, but I really wasn't able to dedicate enough time to it.

Maybe that's the point of `embrace the suck`; accept I am not good at writing, and just write.
Make as much space as I can for it.
Make myself accountable (by writing these goals down)
Then see what happens.

Ignoring all the ones I failed to do, I am very happy with day [23]({{< ref "2025-12-days-of-short-stories-23" >}}), which I think is my best story so far.
I feel the close pacing gave it a good sense of tension and claustrophobia.

If you have followed along with any of the stories, I hope you enjoyed them.
Let me know what you think.

Happy Holidays!
