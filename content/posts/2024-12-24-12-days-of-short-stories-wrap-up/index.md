So, a month ago, I decided to [challenge myself and write twelve short stories]({{< ref "2024-11-24-12-days-of-short-stories" >}}) over a period of twenty-four days.
This is a wash-up of how I thought it went, what I did well, and what I could have improved on.

So, as you can see I managed _most_ of the days, completing 9/12 or 75%.

## Lessons Learned

### Time Management

Part of the challenge was to give myself only two days per story, which worked well for the most part, except when I got busy in the run-up to Christmas.

I can blame the 9^th^ on wanting to have a nice meal with my other half, the 19^th^ on being burnt out at work, and the 21^st^ on having to drive six hours to London and back.

These excuses, however, are pretty thin because I had two days to write each story.
I could have written it on the other day.
That I can blame on poor time management.

The 15^th^ was also a day late and remains unfinished.

Ultimately, I am not going to beat myself up.
During all of this, I was working a full-time job, so these stories were being written in my evenings and weekends.

I am still very happy I managed 75% of the stories.

### Primary vs. Backup Word

In the event that the primary prompt did not give me an idea of what to write, I had a backup word that I could use instead.

Of the nine stories written, I only had to use the backup word once, on the 7^th^.
The primary word was `north`, and although I had ideas of writing something about the 'North Pole', I had a better idea for `sound` that would allow me to try a different style of writing.

If I were to do this again, I would 100% keep the backup word as an option.
Giving my brain an 'out' made the task seem less daunting.
For the most part, however, I just wrote the first thing that came to my head.

On the 3^rd^ I did jump from `point` to `peak`, but the prompts are supposed to be just that, prompts.

### Grammar

My English education did not result in me knowing English very good.
After the second story it became evident that I needed to reach for a Thesaurus frequently if I wanted to avoid using 'said' constantly.

I did need to keep looking up when to use an apostrophe because the rules around that don't stick in my head.

About half way though I realised that writing all the stories in Visual Studio Code was depriving me of a grammar checker, and I suck at grammar.
I don't have an Office 365 licence, and in retrospect I could just have used LibraOffice, but instead I used [https://languagetool.org/](https://languagetool.org/).

Doing this again, I would write in LibraOffice and then translate the text into Markdown (how this blog is powered).

### Point of View

Based on my natural writing style, I can pretty effortlessly manage both first and third person writing.
I relate more to first person so that tends to be my preferred style.

Annoyingly, I missed the only second person story on the 19^th^, but if I am being honest, the idea of writing second person was quite daunting.
I have never read a story that is written from that perspective, so it was going to be quite an interesting and difficult challenge.

If I find myself in the mood I might come back around and write it, with a bit more time to get it right.

### Genre

Now, I'm not a master of genre definitions, so these are probably incorrect, but here are the stories grouped by genre:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD037 -->

| Genre     | Count | Days                                                                                                                                           |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD022 -->

As you can see, most of my stories were Horror and Adventure which I think work well in the thousand-ish word category.
Set up a scenario, and describe what happens as a result.

I thought that, given I almost solely read Sci-fi, most of the stories would fit into that genre.
That did not happen, with most of them being influences by film/TV that I had consumed previously.

An example is the 'Krampus' story on day 5; this was influenced heavily by the [Minstrel Krampus](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543690/) episode of American Dad, which I watched a month or so ago.

Notably absent are Romance, and Fantasy.

### Style

The main takeaway I have about _what_ I wrote, is that the style of my writing does not differ much.
All characters speak the same way and lack a lot of individual traits.
I'm not sure if you can get that kind of uniqueness in a thousand words all the time, but I have seen it done effectively.

[All Systems Red](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0885d5f1-edc2-435f-b17c-7e881829dbc6) did this really well; within the first 5 pages I had a good idea of the personality of the main character.

This is an area I really want to improve on.

I am happy I had a go at an LA Noir ([11]({{< ref "12-days-of-short-stories-11" >}})) style story, and a World War Z ([17]({{< ref "12-days-of-short-stories-17" >}})) inspired one.

## Wrap Up

(It's a Christmas joke)

Overall, I am pleased that I thought of, and executed, this idea.
Each story could have been better, of course, but you don't improve without repetition.
I might try this again in 2025.

I still want to try my hand at writing a longer story.
Let's see if this exercise helped.
