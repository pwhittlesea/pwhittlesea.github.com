summary: I decided to challenge myself to write 12 short stories on 12 random prompts.
---

For some reason at the start of November I decided "Wouldn't it be cool if I tried writing a short story".

Well I have one in progress.

However, I read somewhere recently that when getting into writing you have to `embrace the suck`; the idea that you are not good at something when you start.
So, what better way to try something out than to challenge yourself to do it multiple times in a short space of time; like an accelerated driving course.

Therefore, I am going to try the 'Twelve Days of Short Stories'.
Not strictly related to the [12 days of Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Days_of_Christmas), but kinda.

I will target creating a story every two days, the first on the 1^st^, second on the 3^rd^, and so on up until the 23^rd^ of December.

Two days is not long, so I am hoping it will solve my chronic _OverThinkingAboutEverythingIWrite_-itus.
I will not beat myself up if I miss one, but obviously the goal is to do all of them.

For each day I have generated two words using [a random generator](https://randomwordgenerator.com/); the 'backup' word hopefully giving me an out if my mind is blank on the first.
I also had the crazy idea to target 1^st^, 2^nd^, or 3^rd^ person for each story.

This leaves me with the following prompts:

| Day                                             | Primary Word | Backup Word          | Point of View  |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------|
| [1]({{< ref "12-days-of-short-stories-1" >}})   | `abundant`   | ~~`benefit`~~        | 3^rd^ |
| [3]({{< ref "12-days-of-short-stories-3" >}})   | `point`      | ~~`ideal`~~          | 1^st^ |
| [5]({{< ref "12-days-of-short-stories-5" >}})   | `piano`      | ~~`snow`~~           | 3^rd^ |
| [7]({{< ref "12-days-of-short-stories-7" >}})   | ~~`north`~~  | `sound`              | 1^st^ |
| 9                                               | `dare`       | `style`              | 3^rd^ |
| [11]({{< ref "12-days-of-short-stories-11" >}}) | `link`       | ~~`representative`~~ | 1^st^ |
| [13]({{< ref "12-days-of-short-stories-13" >}}) | `devote`     | ~~`virus`~~          | 1^st^ |
| [15]({{< ref "12-days-of-short-stories-15" >}}) | `grave`      | ~~`brink`~~          | 1^st^ |
| [17]({{< ref "12-days-of-short-stories-17" >}}) | `jam`        | ~~`rib`~~            | 1^st^ |
| 19                                              | `injury`     | `ghost`              | 2^nd^ |
| 21                                              | `flat`       | `radical`            | 1^st^ |
| [23]({{< ref "12-days-of-short-stories-23" >}}) | `glimpse`    | ~~`reasonable`~~     | 3^rd^ |
