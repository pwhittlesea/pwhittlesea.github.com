excerpt: I decided to challenge myself to write 12 short stories on 12 random prompts
---

## Background

For some reason at the start of November I decided "Wouldn't it be cool if I tried writing a short story".

Well I have one in progress.

However, I read somewhere recently that when getting into writing you have to `embrace the suck`; the idea that you are not good at something when you start.
So, what better way to try something out than to challenge yourself to do it multiple times in a short space of time; like an accelerated driving course.

Therefore I am going to try the 'Twelve Days of Short Stories'.
Not strictly related to the [12 days of Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Days_of_Christmas), but kinda.

I will target creating a story every two days, the first on the 1<sup>st</sup>, second on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, and so on up until the 23<sup>rd</sup> of December.

Two days is not long so I am hoping it will solve my chronic _OverThinkingAboutEverythingIWrite_-itus.
I will not beat myself up if I miss one, but obviously the goal is to do all of them.

For each day I have generated two words using [a random generator](https://randomwordgenerator.com/); the 'backup' word hopefully giving me an out if my mind is blank on the first.
I also had the crazy idea to target 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, or 3<sup>rd</sup> person for each story.

This leaves me with the following prompts:

| Day                                                                      | Primary Word | Backup Word      | Point of View  |

Let's see how I do!

## Short Stories

### 1<sup>st</sup> - Abundant

Ben slouched as he waited; staring directly at the food slot.
Food always came at the same times, morning, midday, and evening, everyday; so he knew when to wait.
He knew they would punish him for slouching; it was one of their _rules_.
It was a simple set of rules that he increasingly loathed following; the list etched into the back wall of his cell:

1. Stay clear of the bars
2. Do not destroy your room
3. Use the toilet provided
4. Eat and finish all meals everyday
5. Read all the books provided
6. _No slouching_

The more he thought about that last one the more he wondered if there wasn't some personal vendetta that a guard had against him.
It was out of place, and normally those running the prison in which he stood, hated things that were out of place.

Feeding time, as Ben had come to call it, was the only interesting part of his day.
With only himself for company time was irrelevant but the books they provided him kept him sane.
The 2 hours he spent in the 'recreation center' each day meant that he was in the best shape of his life; if this could be called living.

Ben knew he had been here for about month, but had not seen another living creature in that time.
When he was directed out into the 'recreation center' everyday before lunch &mdash; he had learnt ignoring this direction meant he was docked meals until he cooperated &mdash; he would return to a cleaned cell.
Someone made his bed, removed old food trays, wiped every surface, leaving only his current book &mdash; where he kept a rough count of his days in the prison &mdash; untouched.

Someone was running this prison, but he did not know who.

When Ben had first woken up in his cell he had screamed from the top of his lungs.
Proclaiming innocence, demanding that whoever was running this prison to show themselves, but no one appeared.
The only answer that came was another meal arriving on schedule.
The explanation of why he was here never came.

Until it did.

Ben woke to an unexpected sound.
Looking over to the bars he saw what he could only describe as a monster standing on the other side.

It had the outline of a man, two arms, two legs, a head, and it was standing upright.
If it was a man, Ben surmised it must have been born in a swamp; a thick gel covered it's body
The gel constantly flowed downwards, like waves in a thick custard.
It gave the impression it would leave a trail of the gel everywhere it went, yet somehow the constantly oozing surface never fell to the floor; the ground around the being spotless.

"_b-en_" it said. \
The single syllable word being forced unnaturally from it's voice box was enough to snap Ben from his shock.
He threw himself against the back wall of the cell to put as much space between him and the creature as possible.

"_b-en_" it stuttered once more. \
"Yes" was all Ben managed to say. \
The creature paused, Ben wondered if maybe it was waiting for him to ask questions, until it continued. \
"_we have made sure that you have had all of your requirem-ents in abund-ance_" it enunciated slowly, each syllable coming out unpolished and graceless. \
"_food.
water.
shelter.
physi-cal and mental stimul-ation._" \
"Who are you? Why am I here?" Ben blurted out, his brain finally catching up to the situation at hand. \
"_you are in peak condi-tion_" it stated. \
"What?" Ben queried, "No I'm not in peak condition. I'm pretty far from OK for god's sake!".
He was unable to contain his emotions and he found himself shouting.
"Tell me why I'm here!"

If the creature was annoyed by his aggression it did not show it.
"_you are ready for the next phase_" the creature responded. \
It turned and began to walk away; Ben could not tell if its legs moved or the slime was propelling it. \
"Wait!" Ben protested, "What do you mean next phase? Why am I here? Where is here? Who are you?" \
The creature turned its head slowly towards him.

Stumbling over each word it responded. \
"_you are ready for sale._"

### 3<sup>rd</sup> - Point

I took the liberty of jumping from 'Point' to 'Peak' here.
{: .notice--success}

"Let's keep up the pace" I heard Erwin shout above the wind.

_God, I hate Erwin_ I thought.
It's gotten so bad that I hate his face.
His voice is like nails on a god-damn chalk board; it makes my blood boil.
Every action he takes makes me wish I had never agreed to come on this expedition.

We've been travelling for less than a week so I don't know why I am so damn annoyed by his stupid, stupid face.
It wasn't long since basecamp in Branscomb Glacier but ever since Erwin's feet had hit Mount Vinson he had become a right arse.

_You need to get past it_ I cajoled myself, _concentrate on the climb_.
The four of us were scaling the particularly steep slope from 'High Camp' up to the Peak.
Travelling single file, each of our harnesses bound together in a long line.

The rope tied to my waist went taught and I turned to see what was up with Stefan.
"Are you alright?" I began to shout when I noticed the limp unconscious body of Stefan sliding over the icy surface and over the side of slope.
My blood turned to ice as the adrenaline pumped into my veins.
_You need to brace_ my brain blurted out but it knew it was already too late, my god.
Stefan's going to drag me over the edge.

The rope yanked at the harness around my waist and I was falling; shoes losing their purchase on the slick ice below me.

A shrill scream filled the air, it was me.
I heard Rosario and Erwin shouting after me.
It was too late, slapping my hands and feed into the ground did nothing, they couldn't find purchase on the ice.
_Use your ice axes_ some small corner of my brain was repeating but it couldn't be heard over the panic coursing through my body.

_I'm going to die_.
My feet slipped over the edge, followed closely by the rest of me.
I'll have to talk to Erwin when we get back to Seattle, I'm not sure this relationship can carry on now I've seen this side of him.
_Is that seriously my final thought before I die?!_

My shoulder slammed into the side of the mountain, impacting the freezing cold rock; popping my shoulder.
Searing pain shot along my collar bone; if I lived then it was going to hurt like hell.

God the sky was beautiful, not a cloud in sight.
Somewhere below me Stefan was swinging from his rope and I was probably ruining this view for him; our final vista.
His weight and mine were surely too much for Rosario and she would come toppling over the edge soon.

The rope came to an abrupt halt, flinging me into the back of my harness.
Rosario had somehow braced herself, _she probably didn't panic like you did_.

It had only been seconds since my contempt for Erwin and his face, but I would trade anything to see it one last time.

"Are you OK Noah?" echoed from above, barely audible over the wind howling along the mountainside.\
"I'm alright, Stefan's unconscious" came the response, my response.
Jesus, am I in control any more or am I just a passenger in my own body?

The wind whipped around me, the response unintelligible, my body and Stefans still swinging like some unloved string puppets.
_Please save me_ I begged to no one in particular, the tears freezing on my cheeks stung; maybe a God somewhere will take pity on me.

_Use your ice axes_ the small corner of my brain was repeating and this time it got through the static.
This was no time for self-pity.
With a busted shoulder there was not much hope of pulling myself up and over the ledge with Stefan attached to me, but with Erwin and Rosario pulling too there was a chance.

_There's no second place. Get moving._

The ice axe bit into the side of the mountain and I oriented myself with my feet facing downwards.
Stefan is hopefully still alive but his body is swinging which kept pulling me back away from the edge, but the combination of my pick and cleats kept me in place.

Climbing was hard, one arm dangling uselessly at my side, but there was no other choice.
Stefan wouldn't give up if the roles were reversed.
Besides, I very much wanted to slap his unconscious arse awake so he could witness me strangling him to death instead.

Minute after minute passed, the adrenaline dump could only go on so long and I began to tire.
_The ledge is right there, only a few more feet_.

A gloved hand swooped over the edge and grabbed mine.\
"I've got you" Erwin shouted down as he pulled me up and over the ledge.

Rolling onto my back I joined the effort to pull Stefan up, the last drops energy leaving my body all at once.

We pulled him up and over, secured the lines while Rosario checked on him.\
"He's alive and breathing", thank god, "he's coming to", she said.

I turned to Erwin.\
"I'll never call your face stupid again" I said through blurry eyes as he looked at me with tired and perplexed eyes.
