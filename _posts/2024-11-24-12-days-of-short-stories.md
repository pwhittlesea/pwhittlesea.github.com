excerpt: I decided to challenge myself to write 12 short stories on 12 random prompts
---

## Background

For some reason at the start of November I decided "Wouldn't it be cool if I tried writing a short story".

Well I have one in progress.

However, I read somewhere recently that when getting into writing you have to `embrace the suck`; the idea that you are not good at something when you start.
So, what better way to try something out than to challenge yourself to do it multiple times in a short space of time; like an accelerated driving course.

Therefore I am going to try the 'Twelve Days of Short Stories'.
Not strictly related to the [12 days of Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Days_of_Christmas), but kinda.

I will target creating a story every two days, the first on the 1<sup>st</sup>, second on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, and so on up until the 23<sup>rd</sup> of December.

Two days is not long so I am hoping it will solve my chronic _OverThinkingAboutEverythingIWrite_-itus.
I will not beat myself up if I miss one, but obviously the goal is to do all of them.

For each day I have generated two words using [a random generator](https://randomwordgenerator.com/); the 'backup' word hopefully giving me an out if my mind is blank on the first.
I also had the crazy idea to target 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, or 3<sup>rd</sup> person for each story.

This leaves me with the following prompts:

| Day                                                                      | Primary Word | Backup Word      | Point of View  |
