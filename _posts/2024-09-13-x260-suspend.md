Last week I upgraded my ever-reliable Lenovo x260 ThinkPad to Ubuntu 24.04.

Somewhere in the hour long install process the installer asked me to replace my `/etc/default/grub` file with the default one in the installer.

I didn't remember updating this file, ever, so I accepted the defaults.

Isn't Ubuntu wonderful, I thought, major version updates are so smooth!
However, little did I know, that due to [a little documented issue](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/2031969/) I would not be able to wake my laptop from a suspend state anymore.

When I close the lid, my laptop sleeps, never to be woken from its slumber; stirred only by the harsh application of a long-press of the power button to hard reset it.

My first guess at a cause was a bad upgrade, so I installed a fresh copy of 24.04, which yielded no love.

After a suspicion my hardware was no longer supported, I reinstalled 22.04 to little joy.

Maybe it was the boot drive encryption I dutifully enabled? No such luck.

After 3 fresh installs I scoured forums, until I came across [a comment](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/2031969/comments/27) on the issue above:

This rang a bell, had I changed this file before?
Maybe?

Anyway, a quick edit of my grub config file later and success!
My ThinkPad is usable again!

Thanks Simon Clift, wherever you are!

```sh
# Added this in to help with not being able to resume from suspend
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/2031969/comments/27
# Run sudo update-grub after!
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash intel_iommu=off"
```
