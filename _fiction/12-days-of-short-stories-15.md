excerpt: A short story based on the prompt 'grave'

This is the seventh of a series of short stories I am writing this December.\
[Click here]({% post_url 2024-11-24-12-days-of-short-stories %}) to read the explanation of why I'm writing them.

I was a bit alarming, being shown your own grave.
Well, at least a grave with your own name.\
"You got a gravestone, and then you _carved_ my name on it?!"\
I was mildly impressed, to be honest.
If you could push past the baseball bat, that my hands were tied, and that it was _freezing_ out here, one could be mildly impressed.

We were standing in a graveyard behind the church I had just been captured in; Daniel and his goons had tracked me here and caught me off guard.

"Oui, mon cheri..."\
"Oh, my _god_", I couldn't help but blurt out, "you're not French Daniel, you grew up in Surrey!".\
Daniel pressed his thumb and forefinger to the bridge of his nose.\
"I am _not_ going to let you distract me this time, Sherry.
Just look at the nice gravestone we got engraved with your name to intimidate you into telling us where you hid the god, damn, AMULET".\
The last word came out with seething annoyance, spittle from Daniel's mouth spraying my face.\
"Spray it, don't..." I began to say as he slapped me with the back of his hand.\
"ENOUGH".

"That _hurt_, you shit!" I whispered while wincing, the wind taken from my sails.\
"Good", Daniel said, "maybe now you will listen to what I have to offer".\
"I will make this painfully clear, clearer than the six-foot personalised hole before us can.
Tell us where you hid the Amulet of Nectanebo II, or, we will bury you _alive_".

I looked him up and down.
This mid-level human resources asshole, who looked like he was cosplaying in his daddy's suit, was not going to kill me and give up his only chance of finding the amulet.
"No" I practically spat at him, "over my dead body".\
"A choice set of words" Daniel responded coolly, "a regrettable choice of words".

Silence passed between us for a moment, and I could hear the crows in the trees dotted throughout the graveyard.
Daniel looked behind my left shoulder to look at his thug behind me.\
"Throw her in".

This one is a day late so I didn't get to finish it, apologies!
