I am currently living in Southampton with my partner (whom I dote on), my 4 cats (whom I tolerate) and 2 dogs (whom I fuss over).

:christmas_tree: I have a passion for going overboard at Christmas (see below) which means November is blocked out to put the decorations up, and January to pull them down.

:vampire: I am currently running a D&D campaign with a group of friends.
It's been going for over 3 years now but we _will_ finish [Curse of Strahd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Strahd) at some point...

:video_game: If I can find the time, I try to squeeze in some time playing video games.
[7 Days 2 Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Days_to_Die) and [Baldur's Gate 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_3) are at the top of my roster but I have played [Valheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valheim) and [ARK: Survival Evolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark:_Survival_Evolved) in the past.

:monkey_face: I have been known to replay [Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island) from time to time.

:cake: When not up a ladder, or in-front of a screen, I am on a quest to bake the perfect banana bread, without the soggy bottom.

:book: My partner is always reminding me that I need to read _books_ more.
You can head over to [The StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/gingerphill) to see what I am reading at the moment.

:mortar_board: I graduated from the University of Southampton in 2012 and have since worked my way up the ranks to my current role as Lead Architect.

I'm _supposed_ to be defining the technical strategy of the business but I still enjoy being in the thick of it; my excuse being that it keeps me in touch with the needs of the teams.
Some days I am writing library code that will be used in a handful of applications, other days I am coaching engineers on good software practice.
Occasionally I might be doing my actual job and designing solutions that will have wide ranging impact on the way the business works.
It all depends on what interests me and what's needed of me on a given day.

I am currently at [Cirium](https://cirium.com) in Southampton (which was [Snowflake Software Ltd.](https://www.cirium.com/thoughtcloud/snowflake-software-agrees-to-join-cirium/)).

For more information on my skills and job history, see my [CV](./cv.md).
