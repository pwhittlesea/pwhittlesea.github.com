I am currently living in Southampton with my partner (whom I dote on), my 4 cats (whom I tolerate) and 2 dogs (whom I fuss over).

:christmas_tree: I have a passion for going overboard at Christmas (see below) which means November is blocked out to put the decorations up, and January to pull them down.

:vampire: I am a D&D player, and DM.
I just finished a 4-year play through of [Curse of Strahd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Strahd) (which was only supposed to take a year), so I am taking a bit of a break.
Saying that, I am keen to get started on [Storm King's Thunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_King%27s_Thunder), just in case that takes another 4 years.

*[D&D]: Dungeons & Dragons
*[DM]: Dungeon Master

:video_game: If I can find the time, I try to squeeze in some time playing video games.
[7 Days 2 Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Days_to_Die) and [Split Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_Fiction) are at the top of my roster, but I have played [Valheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valheim) and [ARK: Survival Evolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark:_Survival_Evolved) in the past.

:factory: I hate to admit it, but I have also put a _lot_ of hours into the ever-growing factory that is [Factorio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorio)[^1].

[^1]: 644.1 hours as of the 20<sup>th</sup> April 2025

:monkey_face: I have been known to replay [Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island) from time to time.
You don't have to load it from two floppy disks anymore, but it's still nostalgic.

:cake: When not up a ladder, or in-front of a screen, I am on a quest to bake the perfect banana bread, without a soggy bottom.

:book: My partner is always reminding me that I need to read _books_ more.
You can head over to [The StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/gingerphill) to see what I am reading at the moment.

:mortar_board: I graduated from the University of Southampton in 2012 and have since worked my way up the ranks to my current role as Lead Architect.

I'm _supposed_ to be defining the technical strategy of the business but I still enjoy being in the thick of it; my excuse being that it keeps me in touch with the needs of the teams.
Some days I am writing library code that will be used in a handful of applications, other days I am coaching engineers on good software practice.
Occasionally I might be doing my actual job and designing solutions that will have wide-ranging impact on the way the business works.
It all depends on what interests me and what's needed of me on a given day.

I am currently at [Cirium](https://cirium.com) in Southampton (which was [Snowflake Software Ltd.](https://www.cirium.com/thoughtcloud/snowflake-software-agrees-to-join-cirium/)).
