I am currently living in Southampton with my partner (whom I dote on), my 4 cats (whom I tolerate) and 2 dogs (whom I fuss over).

:christmas_tree: I have a passion for going overboard at Christmas (see below) which means November is blocked out to put the decorations up, and January to pull them down.

:vampire: I am in two D&D campaigns at the moment and I am the DM for one of them.
We are playing [Curse of Strahd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Strahd).

:video_game: I play computer games with my partner and my mother-in-law.
[7 Days 2 Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Days_to_Die) and [Baldur's Gate 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_3) are todays roster but we have played [Valheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valheim) and [ARK: Survival Evolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark:_Survival_Evolved) in the past.

:monkey_face: I have been known to replay [Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island) from time to time.

:cake: When not up a ladder, or in-front of a screen I am on a quest to not get a soggy bottom on my banana bread.
Head over to [The StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/gingerphill) to see what I am reading at the moment.

I graduated from the University of Southampton in 2012 and have since been working my way up the ranks to my current role as a Software Architect.

Which type of architect? Solution? Enterprise? Cloud? Well, I guess I do a mix of it all.
Some days I am writing library code that will be used in a handful of applications, other days I am designing solutions that will have wide ranging impact on the way the business works. It all depends what interests me and whats needed of me on a given day.

I am currently at [Cirium](https://cirium.com) in Southampton (which was [Snowflake Software Ltd.](https://www.cirium.com/thoughtcloud/snowflake-software-agrees-to-join-cirium/)).

For more information on my skills and job history, see my [CV](/cv/).
