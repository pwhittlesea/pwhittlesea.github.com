## Prelude

Humanity noticed the anomaly late in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
The first reports were entirely ignored; the evidence deviating so far from accepted scientific norm that their validity could not even be entertained as anything but sensor malfunctions.

Equipment was checked again and again, furious scientists operating the now obsolete radio telescope were unable to explain the results that lay before them.
Every meter of the gigantic antenna was checked for impact damage and every component of the radio receiver was swapped with a spare.
Finally, when the telescope was given a clean bill of health, all faults ruled out, the scientists wondered if there was an atmospheric factor at play.
Space-based sensor platforms, with their unobstructed view of the universe had become a commodity in the last century, and ground based telescopes had all but become redundant.

Months had passed since their initial discovery, keeping their finding to themselves for fear of looking foolish among the scientific community.
The anomaly was such an affront to accepted fact that only a fool could think it real.

If they were wrong, it meant the end of _Site A_; the operators unlikely to find further work.
Despite this, the scientists privately sought out an orbital platform that could verify their findings.

"Pluto's smudge" as it was later coined by media outlets was indeed there.
Just beyond the aphelion of Pluto a smear sat suspended in space.
Those who believed in a higher power would be forgiven to think that when the night sky was painted their deity was momentarily distracted.
A pen drawing the stars stumbling across the page.

Once the orbital observatory confirmed it was detecting the anomaly the results were published publicly by _Site A_.
Scientific institutes slowly picked up the news across the globe alongside the multitude of platforms in orbit.
Each generating their own unique insults for the obviously idiotic operators of _Site A_ before eventually corroborating the findings.

A new space race began amongst the nations of Earth; racing to be the first to reach the anomaly and discover its true nature.

## Chapter 1

They remembered being shaken.
Or were they currently being shaken?
They filed the input away, comparing it against all the others that slowly flowed into their head; trying to place them in some sort of order.

This is my first attempt at writing fiction.\
There may be more to come, but there may not.\

We shall see.
